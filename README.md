SLogo
=====

Logo is a computer programming language that was originally designed with education in mind. Logo is best known for its "turtle graphics". That is, the ability for the user to control a an object on the screen, the "turtle", which can be made to move around and draw lines as it moves. This project, Simple Logo (SLogo) aims to implement a user-friendly Logo interpreter.

How to launch
-------------
To launch the application, go into the src folder, then into the controller. Run the java class `AppLauncher`.

How to use
----------
When the application launches, you may click on the "New Workspace" button. SLogo has a lot of features, but there is an easy way to see the basics: in the "data" folder, there are many folders which contain sample commands. Feel free to copy a full command and paste it into the text window. Make sure every text item has a space between it and the next item! Then click the "Submit" button and enjoy seeing the turtle execute your commands.

Commands
--------
To see all commands, open up a workspace. In the "Help" tab, select "Command Help".

Advanced features
-----------------
There are many implemented features that are hard to see at a first glance. First of all, you can click on turtles to change them from active to inactive. Second of all, if you double click on a custom command, you can simply enter values for its parameters, and press enter. This will execute the command with those values. You can double click variables in the stored variable window and enter a new value to set their new value. You can also click on the colors in the palette to change the background, and you can use the animation menu to speed up, slow down, pause, or step the animation. Within the File submenu, it is possible to switch between various workspaces, create and remove workspaces, load workspaces with default settings (try Dracula), or load/save variables and commands into/from the current workspace.
